# Boilerplate template for Node Express applications

After writing the same lines code again and again, I felt fraustrated and decided to make this.
This is rather a basic implementation for an Express app. There's no Kubernetes or Docker configs
covered yet, but I'll upgrade to these overtime.

## Features

- Minimal secure middleware setup.
- JWT authentication.
- User model and route system.
- Error handling.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone http://github.com/JasontheOmnivorous/express-boilerplate.git
```

2. Navigate to your project directory:
   cd express-boilerplate

3. Install dependencies:
   npm i

### Usage

npm run dev
